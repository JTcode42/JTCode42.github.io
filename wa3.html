  <h3> An Assault on the Majority: The Despicable Mishandling of Public Offerings </h3>
<p>Robinhood had promised a free option for regular people to trade. The service makes plenty of sense in practice, but when special interest groups and hedge fund
  managers dip their toes in the corporate soup of stock trading things get a bit spicy. Robinhood suspended trading of GME, AMC, and various other stocks offered
  publicly. They did this because they are protecting the hedge funds by minimizimg their losses. If the application was truly intended to be a tool
  for the public to make stock trades, they would not have shut down trading.

  <p>Reddit has a subrieddit called r/wallstreetbets that collaborated on the trading. There have been attempts
  to discredit reddit users, stating they performed market manipulation by sharing the details of the short sell hedge funds were performing on Gamestop.
  This was not an example of insider trading as none of these redditors were officials at Gamestop, at least not as far as I am aware. It is not illegal to give advice
    on the stock market, especially if you are not part of the company being publicly traded. </p>
    
<p>Hedge fund managers that want to go on national television and lie to 
  the public not only displays their greed and immaturity, but displays the disgusting nature of our national news. News outlets decided to air wealthy people and their
  opinions, but missed the audience that performed the stock market volitility in the first place. Do they really think reddit users care what wealthy, sad hedge fund managers have to say?
  the entire point of this event was to spite these weasels in our stock market. The only upside to the news placing these slimebags in front of a camera was seeing them cry on tv. It isn't that I have a problem
  with hedge funds buying and selling stocks, but the audacity they have to immediately point fingers at U.S. citizens, stating they did something wrong by exercising their right to buy and sell stocks is shocking to me.
  Are they the only ones who are allowed to make money on the stock market? No. Fuck them.</p>
  
  <p>It is unfortunate that a service like Robinhood, that seems to have been started with the purest of intentions, was sadly the only perpetrator of market manipulation. Hedge funds are allowed to short sell stocks
  because there isn't really anything illegal about exercising this right to buy and sell, even at bulk. It does feel as if they are operating in a legal grey area but they are in fact operating within their legal 
  boundaries. Robinhood on the other hand, suspended trading, citing volitilaty in several of the emails they sent me. The market was volitile, and that was a good thing. Hedge funds that bet against business for their own personal gain
  can trade whenever the market is open, bankrupting and destroying companies, jobs, and careers with a gamble, and the stock market remains open through it all. Now, more individual people are getting wealthier, but not wealthy, because these users
  are buying and selling with the scraps they were able to conjure up working for their money. Hedge funds didn't like how a greater number of U.S. citizens were making money and they were losing moeny so I have to speculate that one of these hedge funds
    comtacted Robinhood and convinced them to shut down trading to minimize their losses. </p>

   <p>Robinhood made a grave mistake in doing so, because, volitility or not, the users are no longer
  going to trust the platform the next time an opportunity like this presents itself. It is deeply disheartening that a service designed to allow regular people to disrupt the stock market and make money trading stocks
  is just a corrupt and greedy as the hedge funds themselves. I am glad this all happened however, because it showed that regular people can impact the stock market in an economy that has had hedge funds and billionares at the reigns for far
  too long.</p>
