                <h4>Communicating Emotions</h4>
                <span>Antononoka, O.</span>
                <i>Antononoka, O. (2016). COMMUNICATING EMOTIONS: How Commercial Manga for Women Approaches 3.11. Kritika Kultura, (26).</i><br>

                <br><p>This research is essential for two primary reasons. First, There is a focus on emotions in manga, which will benefit my research and elevate my comprehension of how these emotions are depicted. Second, the 3.11 earthquake incident is a devastating and heartbreaking natural disaster that shook the nation of Japan to its core. The research in this scholarly work is focused on Hagio Moto’s manga series “Nanohana”, so I can utilize some similar deductions from this work in my own research without repeating Antononoka’s work on a separate manga entirely. The conclusions the author comes to are fascinating and helpful for understanding Japanese culture better, capturing a moment where Japanese culture recently experienced a disaster, and maybe helpful for making some connections between this event and Attack on Titan.</p>

                <h4>Within and Without</h4>
                <span>Chang Y.</span>
                <i>Chang, Y. H. (2016). Within and Without: Human-Monster Boundary in Attack on Titan. In Edgelands: A Collection of Monstrous Geographies (pp. 1-8). Brill.</i><br>

                <br><p>This is a great source for setting the scene for emotionally taxing experiences the characters must go through. Chang points out that usually the isolating factor is geography where humans must venture beyond a geographical barrier. The genius behind Attack on Titan is that the humans are the isolated ones, trapped behind walls that grant them safety. Now of course the safety the humans felt they had literally crumbles and this leads to an extreme, fight or flight situation for every character behind the walls. The reason I wanted to include this source is because it is helpful for defining the urgency, the intensity, and the in-the-moment emotions the characters are feeling. The author displays credibility given the unique nature of the written analysis. As with many of my articles, the source material was written with interpretation as the center focus. Aside from Isayama himself, nobody is more or less qualified to speak on this topic which makes this a valuable interpretation.

                <h4>Traumatic loss and productive impasse in comics</h4>
                <span>David Lewkowich</span>
                <i>David Lewkowich (2019). Traumatic loss and productive impasse in comics: visual metaphors of depression and melancholia in Jillian and Mariko Tamaki’s This One Summer, Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics</i><br>

                <br><p>This scholarly work is diving into what types of imagery are on display when characters are experiencing something emotionally taxing. The focus is to understand how a single panel image can capture the feelings given the context of the words leading up to the visualization. A common phrase, a picture is worth a thousand words, can sum up the research intentions of this paper. What is unique about this paper is the attention to the narrative behind the imagery, such as pointing out a youthful perspective, making the traumas the characters experience feel fresh and difficult to handle given the protagonist's lack of experience in coping with these emotions. This work is relevant despite being connected to another manga because the analysis performed is similar to the type of analysis I will be performing.</p>

                <br><p>Another great read, this scholarly article out of BSU is a clever summarization of the story behind Attack on Titan. This article mentions the nature of the average manga or anime and how Attack on Titan strays dramatically from the norm. The dark nature of the story is captivating and has reached a large audience. The audience focus in this research will be helpful for defining the readers and the types of emotions the author is attempting to invoke. Cultural norms are not relevant, beyond subtle mentions of Japanese culture, because the author wrote a manga that was distributed globally. Any attempt at digital literature reviews are considered valid in my opinion, as the author is giving their interpretation of the work.</p>

                <br><p>While this paper addresses the noticeable cultural symbolism of Japan in manga, it is a clever resource on media convergence. This paper helps to understand the ways manga may be impacted by global factors and Japanese culture. The Japanese culture comes into play when considering whether or not the emotions depicted in manga are relatable to audiences of all cultures. If I find that there are big enough differences between cultures I may be able to point to the type of cultures that would consume the media in my research and be affected by the emotionally taxing scenes. This author cites multiple credible sources and clearly did their research before publishing their work.</p>

                <br><p>This paper explores the differences between the still images in manga and the animated production known as anime. The differences are just as important to this project as are the similarities. For example, the moving nature of anime characters is seen in linework on manga panels. This difference alone leads to an entirely different experience for the reader/viewer, with the manga reader seeing lines depicting movement while the anime viewer may see a moving background or lines as well. I can use this paper to address those key differences when using the script in natural language processing research down the line.</p>

                <h4>Close-ups: An emotive language in manga</h4>
                <span>Tsai Y.</span>
               <i>Tsai, Y. S. (2018). Close-ups: An emotive language in manga. Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics, 9(5), 473-489.</i><br>

                <br><p>Tsai’s scholarly work is relevant to my project because I wanted to address close-up images in manga because this is a common tactic deployed by Isayama. This work talks about other manga, such as Nakuna Hara-chan, so I can have a more diverse perspective and larger dataset of emotional analysis. The project will be broken up into two parts and this paper will help further my understanding of the illustrative elements of the manga, while other sources will help generate ideas for my natural language processing script. There is an argument in this research that a character’s emotional state is essential to their development and the progression of the manga. This is core to my research questions and similar to the conclusions I expect to make after analyzing the script’s use of language as well.</p>
