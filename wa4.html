<p style="color:MidnightBlue">The television show, Friends, aired for ten seasons. The show featured six friends, named <span class="names">Monica, Chandler, Ross, Joey, Phoebe, and Rachel.</span>. Rachel
  talks too much in this show and is widely regarded as the most annoying character. This analysis looks at the amount of dialogue each friend had in each episode of the show.
  The hope in this analysis is to address the disparity in dialogue between the actors. The data was sourced from a github user, linked above. The data provided integer data based on how many "lines" the character had.</p>
<p>The data analysis begins with a summary statistic, the mean, to determine which actor/actress has the most lines on average. The code for this is linked above in my notebook html after I created the plots. For simplicity I will list out the means here. Chandler 
  had 62.0748 lines on average. Joey had 61.0792 lines on average. Monica had 61.8149 lines, Phoebe had 54.8149, and Ross had 66.8458 lines. Rachel has the most with 69.1938 lines on average.</p>
<p>The chart below is a combination of the six characters dialogue line charts as depicted above. I included this reference to potentially see moment during the show where a particular character had a ton of lines. This chart could potentially
 be used to pinpoint certain episodes. The muddy nature of this chart does lead to confusion however and the individual charts may prove more useful. Some key takeaways are that Rachel talks the most, obviously, and Phoebe, everyone's favorite character gets very little screentime and has the least amount of lines.</p>
<p>Some related work, and quite frankly, really interesting data science pieces have been done centered around this show. This <a href="https://medium.com/@liztersahakyan/the-one-with-the-data-scientist-a-closer-look-at-the-friends-of-friends-d3530d1902af">Medium article</a> depicts the closeness of the friends in terms of their shared storylines. 
  Another piece, this <a href="https://yashuseth.blog/2017/12/29/data-analysis-lead-character-of-friends-data-science/">data science article</a> is very similar to my analysis so I thought I would include it. It uses a bar chart which is another great way to visualize this data if the muddy representation below is too messy.
  This <a href="https://www.whatwouldjackandchrissydo.com/a-data-analysis-of-the-tv-sitcom-friends/">article</a> uses a scatterplot and averages to lay out the same information I tried to communicate.
  </p>
<p>Ultimately, Rachel talks a significant amount, but the writers and producers for the tv show, Friends, were intentional with making sure the characters has nearly equal representation. This could have been because it was difficult to determine who the fan favorites were. If the creators of the show were taking fan favorites into account, it would seem like Rachel was recognized by the shows producers as the 
  most popular and Phoebe was used in certain scenarios as to not take away from relationship dynamics such as Ross and Rachel or Chandler and Monica's relationships. Joey also appears to end up getting less lines as the show progresses. My curiosity in this analysis is whether or not the creators were considering the data while they prepared scripts. Whether they were or not, the scripts are actually really evenly spaced and the friends are equally represented, 
  especially compared ot other shows. </p>
