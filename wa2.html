  <h3> An Assault on the Majority: The Despicable Mishandling of Public Offerings </h3>
<p>Robinhood had promised a free option for regular people to trade. The service makes plenty of sense in practice, but when special interest groups and hedge fund
  managers dip their toes in the corporate soup of stock trading things get a bit spicy. Robinhood suspended trading of GME, AMC, and various other stocks offered
  publicly. They did this because they are protecting the hedge funds by minimizimg their losses. If the application was truly intended to be a tool
  for the public to make stock trades, they would not have shut down trading.
</p>
  <p> Reasoning for Reddit users to take on hedge funds. Reddit has a subrieddit called r/wallstreetbets that collaborated on the trading. There have been attempts
  to discredit reddit users, stating they performed market manipulation by sharing the details of the short sell hedge funds were performing on Gamestop.
  This was not an example of insider trading as none of these redditors were officials at Gamestop, at least not as far as I am aware. It is not illegal to give advice
    on the stock market, especially if you are not part of the company being publicly traded. </p>
    
<p>Hedge fund managers that want to go on national television and lie to 
  the public not only displays their greed and immaturity, but displays the disgusting nature of our national news. News outlets decided to air wealthy people and their
  opinions, but missed the audience that performed the stock market volitility in the first place. Do they really think reddit users care what wealthy, sad hedge fund managers have to say?
  the entire point of this event was to spite these weasels in our stock market.</p>
