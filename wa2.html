  <h3> An Assault on the Majority: The Despicable Mishandling of Public Offerings </h3>

  managers dip their toes in the corporate soup of stock trading things get a bit spicy. Robinhood suspended trading of GME, AMC, and various other stocks offered
  publicly. They did this because they are protecting the hedge funds by minimizimg their losses.
