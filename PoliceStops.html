  <p> My findings are a bit of a mixed bag. The quantity of young drivers is a smaller dataset than the entire police stop data so filtering this population out helps
    conceptualize how many young people are being pulled over. There are more male drivers being pulled over as a whole and that trend is consistent with the younger males as well.
    There are <b>462</b> females that were born in 1997 or later. There are <b>839</b> males that were born in 1997 or later. Young people, (people born on or after 1997), make up <b>15.7%</b>
    of the male traffic stops and <b>16.7</b> of the female traffic stops.</p>
  <p>This data could represent a multitude of interesting findings. Boulder county has a large number of college age individuals living in the county, so the small percentage is sort of surprising.
    This data could represent that there are not very many young people driving in Boulder, and more young people take public transit. The recent completion of driving school may be a factor for determine if
    new drivers will drive safer and more alert. This is somehat unlikely as experience has shown to be a factor in decreasing car accidents but is worth mentioning. Men are pulled over at a higher frequency than women
    at all ages which could also be due to multiple explanations. For example, men could be driving more, although I am inclined to believe that the existence of equal opportunity employment and equality across the board
   , women are likely driving as much as men. There are simply less women being stopped. This is the most certain finding in this data. I am not counting out factors like quantity of female automobile ownership in relation to male ownership,
    however if it ranges anywhere near the population distribution, this data indicates that men are pulled over at a significant and noticably higher frequency.</p>
